## Google Tracking URL Validator

### Description:

The Google Tracking URL Validator is a handy tool designed for validating URLs within files or text strings to ensure they are properly tracked with Google Analytics. It accepts two inputs:

1. **File Input:** Users can input files with extensions such as `.HTML`, `.HTM`, `.MD`, `.MARKDOWN`, or `.TXT`. The tool scans these files to extract URLs and verifies whether they are tagged correctly with Google Analytics parameters.

- **Error Reporting:** If any URLs are found to be missing required tracking parameters, the tool generates a report highlighting these discrepancies for the user's attention.
- **Output:** Users receive a comprehensive report detailing the status of each URL, indicating whether it is properly tracked or requires adjustment.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency:** Saves time by automating the process of checking URL tracking parameters, especially when dealing with numerous URLs across multiple files or within extensive text content.
